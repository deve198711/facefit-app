    <h1>Is Expensive Sunscreen Really Better?</h1>
    <p><strong>Price doesn’t always equal performance</strong> — especially in skincare. So what’s the real difference between that $8 drugstore sunscreen and the $60 luxury brand? Let’s find out.</p>

    <h2>1. What Makes Some Sunscreens Expensive?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✨ Premium ingredients like antioxidants, peptides, or botanical extracts</li>
        <li>🧴 Elegant textures that feel more like moisturizer than sunscreen</li>
        <li>🧪 Patented UV filters that offer better wear or protection</li>
        <li>🌿 Fragrance-free, reef-safe, vegan, or hypoallergenic certifications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>High-end sunscreens may feel better and include skin-benefiting extras, but they don’t always offer better UV protection than cheaper ones. That depends on the SPF and PA ratings — not the price tag.</p>

    <h2>2. SPF 30 vs. SPF 50 — What Should You Choose?</h2>
    <p>It’s not about which one is better — it’s about what fits your lifestyle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🏢 <strong>Indoor or casual use:</strong> SPF 30 is usually enough for most people who stay indoors.</li>
        <li>🏖️ <strong>Outdoor or active life:</strong> Go for SPF 50+ — you’ll need higher protection from stronger sun exposure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Do You Reapply Sunscreen Often Enough?</h2>
    <p>Dermatologists recommend reapplying every 2–3 hours, especially if you’re sweating or in direct sunlight. The truth? Most people don’t apply enough in the first place.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🧴 A nickel-sized amount for your face</li>
        <li>🧴 A shot glass amount (about 1 ounce or 30ml) for your entire body</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Final Verdict</h2>
    <p><strong>You don’t need to break the bank</strong> to protect your skin. Affordable sunscreens can work just as well — if they have the right SPF and you apply them properly. Expensive ones may feel nicer or offer bonus ingredients, but they’re not always “better.”</p>

    <p>Choose sunscreen based on your skin type, comfort, and how often you're realistically going to use it — and don’t forget to reapply!</p>
