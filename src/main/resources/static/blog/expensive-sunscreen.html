    <h1>Is Expensive Sunscreen Really Better?</h1>
    <p>Sunscreens come in all price ranges‚Äîfrom under $10 to over $100. But what exactly makes a sunscreen ‚Äúexpensive,‚Äù and is it really worth it?</p>

    <h2>1. What You‚Äôre Paying For</h2>
    <p>Higher-priced sunscreens often contain additional skincare ingredients like antioxidants, anti-aging compounds, or luxurious textures. However, the core purpose‚ÄîUV protection‚Äîis still delivered by active ingredients like zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, or avobenzone, which are found in both cheap and pricey sunscreens.</p>

    <h2>2. SPF & Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>Some people believe SPF 30 is enough to save money, but your choice should be based on your lifestyle. SPF 30 blocks ~97% of UVB rays, while SPF 50 blocks ~98%‚Äîthe difference is small, but important for those spending long hours outdoors.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>üè¢ Mostly indoors? SPF 30 is probably fine.</li>
        <li>üèñ Outdoor activities or sensitive skin? Go for SPF 50 or higher.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Keep in mind: higher SPF often means more active ingredients, which can be heavier on sensitive skin. Balance protection with your comfort!</p>

    <h2>3. How Often and How Much?</h2>
    <p>Dermatologists recommend reapplying sunscreen every 2‚Äì3 hours when outdoors, especially after sweating or swimming.</p>
    <p>As for how much to use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>üß¥ A nickel-sized dollop for your face (‚âà¬º‚Äì‚Öì tsp)</li>
        <li>üß¥ A shot glass amount (‚âà1 oz or 30ml) for your entire body</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>You don‚Äôt need to spend a fortune on sunscreen to protect your skin. Focus on the SPF, texture you like, and how consistently you use it. A $10 sunscreen used correctly is better than a $60 one that sits unused.</p>
